## Overview

Request a replacement for an account. The first replacement for any account is **auto-approved** — the old account is reclaimed and a new uninitialized account is created immediately. Subsequent replacement requests require manual admin review.

<ParamField body="account_id" type="string" required>
  ID of the account to replace

<ParamField body="reason" type="string">
  Reason for requesting a replacement
</ParamField>
