## Endpoint

```
POST https://api.ugc.inc/post/delete
```

## Overview

Delete one or more posts from your organization. This endpoint handles both scheduled posts and published posts:

- **Unpublished posts** (`scheduled`, `pending`, `failed`, `retrying`) are deleted immediately from the database
- **Published posts** (`complete`) trigger a deletion flow that removes the post from the social media platform (TikTok/Instagram) and then marks it as `deleted`

<Info>
  **Published Post Deletion:**
  
  When deleting a `complete` post, the API will:
  1. Trigger a GeeLark automation to delete the post from the social media platform
  2. Set the post status to `deleting` while the deletion is in progress
  3. Automatically update to `deleted` once the platform deletion completes
  
  You can check the status using the [Get Post Status](/api-reference/endpoint/posts-status) endpoint.

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Deleting published posts:**
  
  When you delete a post that has already been published (`complete` status), the API triggers an automation to remove it from the social media platform. The post status changes to `deleting` and then to `deleted` once the platform deletion completes. Use the [Get Post Status](/api-reference/endpoint/posts-status) endpoint to monitor the deletion progress.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Delete posts">
    Call the delete endpoint with the post IDs you want to remove
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check response">
    The response tells you which posts were deleted immediately vs. queued for platform deletion
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor status (for published posts)">
    For posts being deleted from the platform, monitor their status until it changes to `deleted`
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Bulk Delete with Status Monitoring

```typescript
// Delete multiple posts (mix of published and unpublished)
const deleteResponse = await client.posts.deletePosts({
  postIds: ['post_abc123', 'post_xyz789', 'post_uvw012']
});

if (deleteResponse.ok) {
  // Handle immediately deleted posts
  if (deleteResponse.data.deleted > 0) {
    console.log(`✓ Deleted ${deleteResponse.data.deleted} unpublished posts`);
  }
  
  // Monitor posts being deleted from platform
  if (deleteResponse.data.deleting > 0) {
    console.log(`⏳ Deleting ${deleteResponse.data.deleting} published posts from platform...`);
    
    // Poll status until deletion completes
    for (const postId of deleteResponse.data.deletingIds) {
      const checkStatus = async () => {
        const statusResponse = await client.posts.getStatus({ postId });
        
        if (statusResponse.ok) {
          if (statusResponse.data.status === 'deleted') {
            console.log(`✓ Post ${postId} deleted from platform`);
            return true;
          } else if (statusResponse.data.status === 'failed') {
            console.error(`✗ Post ${postId} deletion failed`);
            return true;
          }
        }
        return false;
      };
      
      // Check every 10 seconds until complete
      const interval = setInterval(async () => {
        const done = await checkStatus();
        if (done) clearInterval(interval);
      }, 10000);
    }
  }
  
  // Handle any errors
  if (deleteResponse.data.errors && deleteResponse.data.errors.length > 0) {
    console.error('Some posts failed to delete:', deleteResponse.data.errors);
  }
}
```
