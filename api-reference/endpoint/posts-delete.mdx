## Endpoint

```
POST https://api.ugc.inc/post/delete
```

## Overview

Delete one or more posts from your organization. This endpoint allows you to remove scheduled or failed posts.

<Warning>
  **Important Restrictions:**
  - You can **only** delete posts with status `scheduled`, `pending`, `failed`, or `retrying`
  - Posts with status `complete` (already posted to social media) **cannot** be deleted
  - This prevents accidental deletion of live content
</Warning>

## Request Body

<ParamField body="postIds" type="string[]" required>
  Array of post IDs to delete
  
  All posts must belong to your organization and must not have status `complete`
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="data" type="object">
  Deletion result information
  
  <Expandable title="Result properties">
    <ResponseField name="deleted" type="number">
      Number of posts successfully deleted
    </ResponseField>
    
    <ResponseField name="ids" type="string[]">
      Array of deleted post IDs
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

## Error Cases

- **400 Bad Request**: Attempting to delete posts that have already been posted (status `complete`)
- **404 Not Found**: Some posts don't exist or don't belong to your organization

<RequestExample>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.ugc.inc/post/delete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "postIds": ["post_abc123", "post_def456"]
  }'
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.ugc.inc/post/delete',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    json={
        'postIds': ['post_abc123', 'post_def456']
    }
)

data = response.json()

if data['ok']:
    print(f"Deleted {data['data']['deleted']} posts")
else:
    print(f"Error: {data['message']}")
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.ugc.inc/post/delete', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    postIds: ['post_abc123', 'post_def456']
  })
});

const data = await response.json();

if (data.ok) {
  console.log(`Deleted ${data.data.deleted} posts`);
} else {
  console.error(`Error: ${data.message}`);
}
```

```typescript React
import { UGCClient } from 'ugcinc';

const client = new UGCClient({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
});

// Delete multiple posts
const response = await client.posts.deletePosts({
  postIds: ['post_abc123', 'post_def456']
});

if (response.ok) {
  console.log(`Successfully deleted ${response.data.deleted} posts`);
  console.log('Deleted IDs:', response.data.ids);
} else {
  console.error(`Error: ${response.message}`);
  // Common errors:
  // - "Cannot delete X post(s) that have already been posted"
  // - "Some posts not found or don't belong to your organization"
}
```

}
```

</ResponseExample>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Check post status before deleting:**
  
  Always verify that posts are not yet published before attempting to delete them. Use the [Get Posts](/api-reference/endpoint/posts-get) endpoint to check post statuses first.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fetch posts">
    Use the Get Posts endpoint to retrieve posts and check their status
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter deletable posts">
    Filter out posts with status `complete` from your deletion list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete posts">
    Call the delete endpoint with the filtered post IDs
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Safe Bulk Delete

```typescript
// Get all posts
const postsResponse = await client.posts.getPosts();

if (postsResponse.ok) {
  // Filter posts that can be deleted (not yet posted)
  const deletablePosts = postsResponse.data.filter(
    post => post.status !== 'complete'
  );
  
  if (deletablePosts.length > 0) {
    const deleteResponse = await client.posts.deletePosts({
      postIds: deletablePosts.map(p => p.id)
    });
    
    if (deleteResponse.ok) {
      console.log(`Deleted ${deleteResponse.data.deleted} posts`);
    }
  }
}
```
