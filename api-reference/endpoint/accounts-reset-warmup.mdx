## Endpoint

```
POST https://api.ugc.inc/accounts/reset-warmup
```

## Overview

Reset warmup activity for an account. This endpoint has two modes:

- **Reset mode** (default): Resets the run count for all warmup tasks, causing them to re-execute
- **Delete mode**: Completely removes all warmup tasks from the account

This is useful when you want to restart the warmup process or clear all warmup activity.

## Request Body

<ParamField body="accountId" type="string" required>
  The ID of the account to reset warmup for
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="delete_activity" type="boolean" default={false}>
  If `true`, deletes all warmup tasks completely. If `false` (default), resets task run counts so they will re-execute
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  Success message describing the action taken
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tasks_affected" type="number">
  Number of warmup tasks that were reset or deleted
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="action" type="'reset' | 'deleted'">
  The action that was performed: `'reset'` if tasks were reset to re-run, `'deleted'` if tasks were removed
</ResponseField>

## Reset vs Delete

### Reset Mode (`delete_activity: false`)

- Tasks remain in the database but are marked to re-run
- Task history is preserved
- Warmup will resume from the beginning
- Use when you want to restart warmup while keeping task records

### Delete Mode (`delete_activity: true`)

- All warmup tasks are permanently removed
- Task history is lost
- Account can have fresh warmup tasks scheduled
- Use when you want to completely clear warmup activity
