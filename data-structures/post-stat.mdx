## How Post Stats Work

<Note>
  Post stats are snapshots in time. Multiple stat records may exist for a single post, allowing you to track performance over time.
</Note>

### Creating Stats

Post stats are automatically created when you use the `/stats/refresh` endpoint:

1. Fetches fresh statistics from TikTok/Instagram API
2. Creates a new `post_stats` record for each post
3. Each record includes a timestamp for historical tracking

### Time-Series Data

The time-series nature of post stats allows you to:

- Track how a post performs over its lifetime
- Identify viral growth patterns
- Compare early vs. late performance
- Generate trend reports

## Engagement Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `views` | Number of times the post was viewed |
| `likes` | Number of likes/hearts the post received |
| `comments` | Number of comments on the post |
| `shares` | Number of times the post was shared |
| `saves` | Number of times the post was saved/bookmarked |
