## Billing Request

Billing requests represent user requests for account replacements or refunds. Replacement requests for first-time accounts are auto-approved; all other requests require admin review.

```typescript
interface BillingRequest {
  id: string;
  org_id: string;
  account_id: string;
  type: 'replacement' | 'refund';
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'denied';
  reason: string | null;
  created_at: string;    // ISO 8601
  resolved_at: string | null;  // ISO 8601
}
```
