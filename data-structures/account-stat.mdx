## Overview

Represents statistics for an account at a specific point in time.

## Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Unique stat record identifier |
| `account_id` | `string` | Associated account ID |
| `followers` | `number \| null` | Follower count at the time of recording |
| `following` | `number \| null` | Following count at the time of recording |
| `views` | `number \| null` | Total content views across all posts |
| `likes` | `number \| null` | Total likes received across all posts |
| `created_at` | `string` | ISO 8601 timestamp when stat was recorded |

## How Account Stats Work

<Note>
  Account stats are created by aggregating post-level metrics. The `views` and `likes` fields represent totals across all posts associated with the account.
</Note>

### Creating Stats

Use the `/stats/refresh` endpoint to fetch fresh statistics from the TikTok/Instagram API:

1. Fetches account profile stats (followers, following)
2. Fetches stats for all posts associated with the account
3. Creates an `account_stats` record with aggregated post metrics
4. Creates individual `post_stats` records for each post

### Time-Series Data

Multiple stat records can exist for a single account, allowing you to track growth and performance over time. Each record includes a `created_at` timestamp indicating when the snapshot was taken.

## Example Response

```json
{
  "id": "stat_abc123",

  "views": 1250000,
  "likes": 89500,
  "created_at": "2024-12-25T10:00:00Z"
}
