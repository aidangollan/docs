## Welcome to UGC Inc API

The UGC Inc API allows you to programmatically manage social media accounts, create and schedule posts, track statistics, and automate account warming tasks for TikTok and Instagram.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.ugc.inc
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the request headers:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Getting Your API Key

To access accounts and receive an API key:

1. Visit [ugc.inc](https://ugc.inc)
2. **Schedule a call** with our team
3. After your call, you'll receive access to accounts and your API key

<Warning>
  **Keep your API key secure!** Never commit it to version control or expose it in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Installation

### NPM Package (Recommended)

We provide an official TypeScript/JavaScript client with full type safety:

```bash
npm install ugcinc
```

```typescript
import { UGCClient } from 'ugcinc';

const client = new UGCClient({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key-here'
});
```

### Direct API Calls

You can also make direct HTTP requests to the API endpoints using any HTTP client.
